<b>Summary</b>

This is my snake game written in Javascript.  The user can move the snake up, down, left, and right to eat the apple that's randomly generated on the screen.  The snake needs to avoid crashing into the wall and into itself while attempting to eat the apple.  The user's score is updated every time the snake eats the apple.  The user will be alerted if the snake crashes into the wall or itself. 

The most interesting and conceptually challenging aspect of coding this game was understanding that a running game is constantly looping and running calculations at near instantaneous speeds and learning how to handle the logical processes accordingly.  I ran into the most difficultly attempting to copy the snake body's path and using it lead the rest of the snake and I wasn't able to solve this problem until I had a good grasp of mapping arrays and how to make a working copy of it.  Given this was my first real intro to gaming, I'm looking foward to working on other applications that build upon this concept.
